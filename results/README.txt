This folder contains semantic similarity results and results from subsequent analyses of the similarity results. 

Semantic similarity results are computed at three annotation granularities, Entities+Qualitites (EQ), Entites+Attributes (EA), and Entities only (E). Semantic similarity is computed using a combination of a metric (Jaccard or Resnik) and a profile aggregation method (Best pairs symmetric (bp_sym) or groupwise). 

Each file name reflects the parameters used to compute the similarities. For example, E_bp_sym_pic_resnik_Results indicates that the similarity scores are for Entities only using Best Pairs Symmetric Resnik Profile IC.
